### Hi there! 🌌

I'm CaptCaptain, and I work on random projects using video game dev tools such as the Overwatch Workshop.

### Featured Projects
#### [🌋 Survive the Disasters!](https://workshop.codes/GWZB4)
[![Survive the Disasters](/survive-the-disasters.png)](https://workshop.codes/GWZB4)

Survive the Disasters is a custom game mode developed using the Overwatch Workshop. Players have to survive a series of disasters ranging from natural to artificial hazards. The mode is written in **[🐍OverPy](https://github.com/Zezombye/overpy)**, a Python style high level language for the Workshop. I completed this project solo, being responsible for creating and developing the mode as well as the art used in the thumbnail.

#### [⚒️ SVB's Creator PUGs](https://workshop.codes/81N8C)

SVB's Creator PUGs was a event organized by content creator SVB to test potential Overwatch 2 changes with other content creators. The mode is written in **[🐍OverPy](https://github.com/Zezombye/overpy)**, with my changes being in **[📝OSTW](https://github.com/ItsDeltin/Overwatch-Script-To-Workshop)** before being merged. I'm responsible for changes to multiple heroes such as:
- a change to the hero Orisa that gives her an ability to gallop forward to deal damage
- a change to the hero Mercy that gives her an ability to allow her teammates to fly
- a system for transferring changes to the hero Echo when using her ability to duplicate another hero, ensuring the hero functions as close as possible to how she does in-game
